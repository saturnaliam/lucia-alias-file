## what is this
hi this is just bc i wanted to work on the lucia keybinds file but didnt have much time so this is just an alternative project

## tell me abt the format
okay!!
```
alias name || command ## optional comment
```
for example, if you wanted to alias emacs to be emacs client, you could do:
```
emacs || emacsclient ## opens up the emacs client
```
which would then become:
```
alias emacs="emacsclient" # opens up the emacs client
```
